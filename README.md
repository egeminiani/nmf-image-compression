<br/><br/>
This repository contains a gentle introduction to nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). It gives an overview of the method's technical details, the most common numerical algorithms for solving the factorization problem, and its recent extensions.

We consider an application of NMF to the field of image processing. More specifically, the painting [*Madonna of the Goldfinch*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna_del_cardellino) (Madonna del Cardellino) by the Italian artist Raphael is optimally compressed through a low-rank approximation of the pixel intensities matrix.

## Usage

The analysis code is contained in the R Markdown report `ImageCompression.Rmd`. <br/> 
If you just what to have a look at the rendered notebook, please refer to `ImageCompression.html`. <br/>
The `Workspace` folder collects the workspace images with the estimated NMF models.
